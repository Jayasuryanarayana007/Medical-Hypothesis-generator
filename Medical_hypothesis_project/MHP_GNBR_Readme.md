# MEDICAL HYPOTHESIS GENERATOR based on GNBR dataset

## Problem Statement (Big)

Developing a drug for a disease is a highly capital intensive, time consuming, and it takes a lot of human work. So before starting the process of finding a cure to a disease, pharmacologists do a research on the disease, and they prepare a medical hypothesis on which they are highly confident about. Then they continue their research and development of cure to the disease.

This project targets the early stage of the research which is about medical hypothesis. We are trying to provide valid medical hypothesis associated to the disease which is backed by literature. So that the researchers can find any medical hypothesis, which is hidden in the literature. But no one knows about it.

This can help the researchers to invest their time more on figuring out medical hypothesis which don’t have good literature backing. Hence increasing their efficiency.

## Problem Statement (Simple)

Developing a drug for a disease is a highly capital intensive, time consuming, and it takes a lot of human work. It involves fixing a medical hypothesis on which you can carry your R&D to find cure. Traditional methods might not notice the hidden patterns of disease, gene drugs in the literature.

We can save good amount of time and capital by figuring out the existing relations between drugs, genes and diseases which is backed by literature.

## Idea

The model takes a disease input and gives the list of hypothesis with good confidence score associated to it.

## Idea (Simple)

Takes a disease input and ranks the medical hypothesis with good literature backing.

## Pipeline of the Project

1. Data preprocessing  
2. Train the model (Increase link prediction efficiency).  
3. Validation of the output (test cases are present in other research papers).

## Question

### 1) How to find a threshold confidence score to segregate medical hypothesis in order to provide high quality medical hypothesis

---

# Pipeline of the Model

## 1) Generate all the medical hypothesis of a certain disease/drug associated with it

Nothing but generate all the paths with good confidence score.

## 2) Filter the hypothesis based on the threshold confidence score

# Finding out Medical Hypothesis

In a knowledge graph, a proper medical hypothesis can be generated by finding out the resultant drug, gene and disease paths with themes inhibition or cure or healing.

Patterns with high proximity have a scope to be better medical hypothesis. In order to quantify the confidence on the medical hypothesis based on the dataset, we have to associate a confidence score to each pattern, based on the proximity of the nodes of the path.

Even though this is a Graph dataset, we aren’t using the term “paths” consciously, because the relationships in the dataset can’t have simple and direct relations. So we are going to figure out patterns, with multiple nodes connected, collectively becoming a pattern in the graph dataset, which has the resultant theme pointed to healing with a good confidence score.

**Note:** Here patterns are synonymous to Medical hypothesis. Because in the graph each high quality pattern with the theme is equivalent to a medical hypothesis.

# Key Things the Model Should Do

1. The model should find the patterns associated to a certain disease.  
2. We use link prediction for finding medical hypothesis. (This part should be highly efficient)  
   - **Important task:** Increase the efficiency of link prediction  
3. Those patterns should have a resultant theme as Inhibition, healing etc.  
4. Consider only patterns which are having the valid theme.  
   - **Important task:** Filtering out the valid themes  
5. In order to quantify the confidence of the literature on the valid pattern, a confidence score has to be associated to each pattern.  
6. Calculating confidence score to a certain pattern  
   - **Important task:** Should develop a standard method to quantify the confidence of the literature based on the confidence scores on the edges between nodes  
7. Calculate confidence score to all patterns related to the disease.  
8. Filtering the patterns based on threshold confidence score.  

   **Note:** Patterns with confidence score more than the threshold confidence score can be considered as Medical hypothesis with strong literature backing.  

   - **Important task:** Should find valid threshold confidence score  

9. Ranking the resultant patterns based on the confidence score associated to it.  
10. Idea is that Rank 1 pattern can be used as a medical hypothesis to do research or to test.  
11. Medical hypothesis generator should also list out the papers from which this hypothesis has been generated.  
12. Researchers have to validate the output generated by the model by real time testing. Even though the model finds out the medical hypothesis with good literature backing. Because researching and developing a drug is highly capital and time intensive. So in order to minimize the waste of time, capital and human work. Researchers have to test the medical hypothesis and then continue their research.  
13. If the medical hypothesis is valid, they can invest their capital, time, and expertise to do research and develop a drug for the disease.

# Challenging Tasks: Increasing Efficiency and Validating the Outputs

## Efficiency of the Link Prediction

### Questions

- While training the model, how do we make it more efficient?  
- In other words while training the model, what will be the reference or absolute truth to which we can compare the results of the model to calibrate its link prediction efficiency?  
- Efficiency of predicting valid patterns which are truly backed by the dataset.  
- The confidence score associated to a medical hypothesis, should quantify the confidence of the literature or it should signify the strength of the literature backing.

## Validation

D. Sosa have used a gold-standard test set of known drug indications. They validated using external literature sources and protein interaction networks.

# Plan

## Tasks

1. Understand the dataset properly, read research paper and understand dataset produced also.  
2. Do literature survey on Link prediction.  
3. Implement Link prediction.  
   - Note: The links or patterns produced, we should be able to reference the research papers from the pattern that is produced.  
4. How to Increase efficiency of link prediction.  
5. How to Find the patterns among the set of patterns with themes which are indicating towards inhibiting the disease.  
6. Develop a standard method to quantify the confidence of literature on the pattern, based on the confidence score associated with each edges.  
7. How to calculate confidence score for all the patterns in the run time.  
8. Research and figure out proper threshold score, which can be used to eliminate less quality patterns.  
9. How to Rank medical hypothesis based on respective confidence score.  
10. How to validate.  
11. How to validate using external literature sources.
